57,71.0,ray,3000.0,X-Large,20.0,2,2x1,Yes,"The ray is an unusually shaped fish with a flat body and a long body, somewhat related to sharks. Seen from the bottom, the mouth on its stomach appears to be smiling, which is objectively adorable. But be cautious—unlike most cute animals, some rays are extremely venomous. BEWARE THE SMILE.",I caught a ray! A few more and I'll have a tan!,71.0,Pet,Brown,Black,Fluorescent,Fish59
58,60.0,red snapper,3000.0,Large,0.0,5–7,1x1,Yes,"Red snapper' is the common name of dozens of fish species, and I wonder why it is so popular. Are there so many types of fish that are both a shade of red and have a tendency to snap? Were there no other names? What about 'burgundy biter'? 'Garnet grasper'? 'Puce pincher'?",I caught a red snapper! It looks pretty dapper!,71.0,Pet,Red,Black,Fluorescent,Fish49
59,65.0,ribbon eel,600.0,Long,0.0,2,2x1,Yes,"The ribbon eel is related to the moray eel, though its bright coloration distinguishes it. It also has an unusual plant-like appendage at the tip of its nose that flutters as the creature moves.

61,31.0,salmon,700.0,Large,0.0,20,2x1,Yes,"Ah, salmon! Did you know their coloration is due specifically to their diet? Indeed, this is the case! The more they fill their diet with crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, the deeper shade of pink they are. If they ate a bushel of carrots, might they turn orange?",I caught a salmon!

62,72.0,saw shark,12000.0,X-Large w/Fin,50.0,1,2x1,Yes,"As you might expect from the name, the saw shark is a shark with a head that resembles a saw. This unusual appendage is used both to dig potential prey out of the sand and as a weapon against said prey.

63,59.0,sea bass,400.0,X-Large,0.0,11–18,2x1,Yes,"Sea bass is a name given to a variety of different species of saltwater fish. They are a varied bunch with some as small as four inches and some as staggeringly ginormous as eight feet! 'Sea bass' is a bit pedestrian though.

A very rough translation of that is 'shell body.' Indeed, this illustrious creature is related to snails! However, it reminds me much more of an elegant feathered friend, the way it flies through the water. With such grace in flying, one shouldn't wonder if it's related to the owl, hoo hoo!",I caught a sea butterfly! Try not to confuse it for a sea moth!,71.0,Pet,White,Black,Fluorescent,Fish37
65,48.0,sea horse,1100.0,X-Small,0.0,5–7,1x1,No,"Ah, a favorite of mine, to be sure! The sea horse is such a very unique creature and is indeed a fish! Though, as far as fish go, sea horses are not great swimmers. The sea horse, you see, has but a wee fin on its back, which propels it through water rather poorly. Thus these fish are often found using their prehensile tails to hold tight in amongst the sea grass. And here's one final fact for you... Sea horses have no stomach and so must constantly feed to stay alive! Indeed, the life of a land horse sounds far easier than that of the hardworking horse of the sea.",I caught a sea horse!

Although they can be quite shy, they will become a bit aggressive when threatened. They are often found in water and are very good swimmers because of the flat shape of their shells. They swim with their snouts over the surface of the water so they can breathe. Soft-shelled turtles aren't safe to hold because they are so prone to biting at the slightest movement. However, if one bites down on you, it will usually let go when you put it safely back in the water.",I caught a soft-shelled turtle!

68,63.0,squid,500.0,Medium,0.0,7–10,1x1,Yes,"Well, first off, squids are members of the mollusk family, just like the octopus. Many mollusks like snails and clams have shells, but the squid's body is almost completely soft. The exception is a long, narrow bit of hard material going through its main body - the last remnant of its shell. Of course, having your shell INSIDE is not a best practice.

One curious behavior of theirs is leaping high out of the water and falling back in on their sides.

71,76.0,suckerfish,1500.0,X-Large w/Fin,20.0,2,1x1,Yes,"The suckerfish is a curious fish that likes to attach itself with its sucker mouth to larger marine animals. The benefit to the suckerfish is that it gets to eat smaller parasites and dead skin off the host's body. Amusingly, some people have used suckerfish on cords to catch large turtles with the fish's own suction!

Unlike many of their kin in the shark family, whale sharks are nonviolent, eating only plankton and such. They grow slowly and live long, relaxed lives of filter feeding and leisure in warm waters.
